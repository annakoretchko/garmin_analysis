I am an avid running and love using my Garmin Forerunner 945 to collect all the data available while I run. Over the past 8 years, I have accumulated quite a large amount of data. I created this python package for anyone to analyse their Garmin Data from the Garmin Connect site and gain deeper understanding about their running analytics!

If you wanna try on your own but don't have a Garmin account, feel free to use the data in the demo-data folder!

Check out demo of the graphs here, on my website! https://anna-koretchko.ue.r.appspot.com/

How to run:

Downdload lastest whl from from the dist folder (here)

create env

cd to downloaded whl file

pip install whl file

python -m garmin_analysis -data "<path to data file from Garmin Connect" -output_path "<path to where you want the output files to be saved"
